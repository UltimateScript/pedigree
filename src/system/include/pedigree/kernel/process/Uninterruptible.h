/**
 * Uninterruptible provides an RAII helper to move the current thread into
 * an uninterruptible state. That means the thread will be able to be
 * scheduled, but will not be able to have any events sent to it until it
 * ceases to be uninterruptible. This can be important in certain cases where
 * an event would cause a re-entry into a mutual exclusion critical section or
 * some other undesirable event.
 *
 * \note Threads cannot be set uninterruptible without using this.
