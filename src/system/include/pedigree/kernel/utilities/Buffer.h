 * Provides a buffer of a specific size and utility functions for integration
 * with e.g. File or other kernel systems.
 *
 * allowShortOperation defines the action to take on overflow. If true, the
 * buffer's write() operation is permitted to return a size less than requested
 * if the buffer would overflow. Otherwise, the implementation is required to
 * block until bytes are present (unless blocking has been explicitly denied).
 *
 * Note that an attempt to read when writing is disabled that would block will
 * always return the number of bytes read so far (or zero if none yet). The
 * same is true for an attempt to write when reading is disabled if that would
 * block.
